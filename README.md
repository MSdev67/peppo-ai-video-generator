Peppo AI Video Generator
This is a minimal AI video generation web app that takes a user prompt as input, generates a short video based on the prompt using the Replicate API, and displays the generated video in the browser.

Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+

Node.js and npm

A Replicate account and API token

Backend Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/peppo-ai-video-generator.git
cd peppo-ai-video-generator/backend

Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a .env file and add your Replicate API token:

REPLICATE_API_TOKEN="your_replicate_api_token"

Run the backend server:

flask run

The backend server will be running at http://localhost:5000.

Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:

cd ../frontend

Serve the frontend files. You can use any simple HTTP server. If you have Node.js installed, you can use serve:

npx serve

The frontend will be accessible at a local URL, typically http://localhost:3000.

Deployment to Render
Create a new Web Service on Render.

Connect your GitHub repository.

Configure the build and start commands:

Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Start Command: gunicorn backend.app:app

Add your REPLICATE_API_TOKEN as an environment variable in the Render dashboard.

Deploy the service.

Innovation and Enhancements
Improved UI: The current UI is minimal. It could be enhanced with a better design, loading animations, and more user-friendly features.

Caching: To reduce costs and improve performance, you could implement a caching mechanism to store and reuse previously generated videos for the same prompts.

Prompt Improvements: You could add features to help users write better prompts, such as providing examples or using a language model to suggest improvements.

RAG-based Context Injection: For more advanced use cases, you could implement a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to inject relevant context into the prompts, leading to more accurate and context-aware video generation.

Security
API Key Management: The Replicate API key is stored in a .env file and loaded as an environment variable, which is a secure way to manage secrets. The .env file should be added to .gitignore to prevent it from being committed to the repository.

CORS: The backend uses flask-cors to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing the frontend to make requests to the backend from a different origin.# peppo-ai-video-generator
